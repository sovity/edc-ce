### About The Project

[Eclipse Dataspace Components](https://github.com/eclipse-edc) (EDC) is a framework for building dataspaces, exchanging data securely with ensured data sovereignty.

[sovity](https://sovity.de/) extends the EDC Connector's functionality with extensions to offer enterprise-ready managed services like "Connector-as-a-Service", out-of-the-box fully configured DAPS and integrations to existing other dataspace technologies.

This repository contains our sovity Community Edition EDCs, containing pre-configured Open Source EDC Extensions.

Check out our [Getting Started Section](./#getting-started) on how to run a local sovity Community Edition EDC.

### sovity Community Edition EDC

Our sovity Community Edition EDC takes available Open Source EDC Extensions and combines them with our own open source EDC Extensions from this repository to build ready-to-use EDC Docker Images.

See [here](launchers/) for a list of our sovity Community Edition EDC Docker Images.

([back to top](./#readme-top))

### sovity Community Edition EDC Extensions

Feel free to explore and use our [EDC Extensions](extensions/) with your EDC setup.

We packaged critical extensions for compatibility with our EDC UI and general usability features into [sovity EDC Extensions Package](extensions/sovity-edc-extensions-package/).

([back to top](./#readme-top))

### Compatibility

Our sovity Community Edition EDC and sovity Community Edition EDC Extensions are targeted to run with our [sovity/edc-ui](https://github.com/sovity/edc-ui).

Our sovity Community Edition EDC will use the current EDC Milestone with a certain delay to ensure reliability with a new release. Earlier releases currently are not supported, but will be supported, once the base EDC has a reliable version.

### Getting Started

The fastest way to get started is our [Getting Started Guide](broken-reference) which takes you through the steps of either starting a local [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml) or deploying a productive sovity EDC CE or MDS EDC CE Connector.
