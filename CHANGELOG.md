# sovity EDC CE Changelog

The versions of the sovity EDC CE are aligned with the sovity EDC EE.

## [v12.0.0] - 2025-04-08

### Overview

EDC UI Rework in React + Next + ShadCN-UI + Tailwind with a new look-and-feel and more flexibility for future implementations.

#### Major Changes

- The EDC UI has been rewritten in React + NextJS + ShadCN-UI + Tailwind with a new look-and-feel
  - Linkable detail / action pages for catalogs, catalog data offers, contracts and assets
  - The catalog fetching multiple connector catalogs at once has been retired in favor of linkable pages and quick access to preconfigured counterparty catalog
  - New style: Prefer Custom Tailwind Style to Angular Material Style
  - New style: Prefer tables to cards
  - New style: Prefer single-page forms with sections to wizards
  - New style: Prefer linkable pages to dialogs and slide-overs
- The EDC UI config system has been reworked. The system of `EDC_UI_`-prefixed environment variables has been replaced by the `UiConfig` API object. See deployment migration notes for detailed changes to the configuration of affected components

### Patch Issues

- Improved Catalog performance 4-fold by optimizing parts of the Eclipse EDC Java code in our fork. Unfortunately, due to the catalog request being `O(NÂ²)` due to in-code filtering of contract definitions and application of policies, this only allows for twice the amount of contract definitions before hitting constraints. [Core-EDC Fork 0.7.2.2](https://github.com/sovity/core-edc/releases/tag/v0.7.2.2)

### Known Issues

- EDRs have issues on this version
- Documentation is out-of-date and will be amended on subsequent releases
- Some detail page requests are unoptimized right now:
  - Missing findById implementations
  - Frontend-side pagination

- EDC CE Frontend: `ghcr.io/sovity/edc-ce-ui:12.0.0`
- PostgreSQL: `16`

## [v11.0.0] - 2025-03-10

### Overview

Catena-X support. New custom module system with a single launcher. Migrate to Tractus-X 24.08 and Core EDC 0.7.2. Relicensing to Elastic License 2.0.

#### Major Changes

- After careful deliberation we have decided to re-license the sovity Community Edition EDC to `Elastic License 2.0`
  - If you are self-hosting your connectors, nothing changes for you.
  - If you plan to contribute to this repository or have contributed to this repository in the past, your source code will remain under `Apache License 2.0`.
  - If you are hosting connectors for a third party, please make sure to carefully read the `Elastic License 2.0` and our explanation [here](https://github.com/sovity)
  - For more details, please see our vision behind the sovity Community Edition [here](https://github.com/sovity)
- Breaking changes to Connector Docker Images, Versions and Configuration:
  - Unified versioning across all the sovity EDC Connectors and the sovity EDC UI for simplicity
  - Unified variants through new config and module system
  - Auto-documented configuration system
  - All sovity-specific configuration related to the EDC is now prefixed as `sovity.`
- Ongoing migration from Java to Kotlin
- Bumped Eclipse EDC to `0.7.2`
- Bumped Tractus-X EDC to `0.7.7` / `24.08 Jupiter`
- Parameterization for HTTP Push Transfers is no longer available
  - Due to our UI only supporting HTTP Push, parameterization when initiating transfers is no longer available in our UI
- Referring connector policy no longer evaluates the `EQ` operator like `IN`:
  - For the participant `x` a policy using`REFERRING_CONNECTOR EQ "x, y"` does not evaluate to `true` anymore, because `["x"] != ["x", "y"]`.
  - Both `REFERRING_CONNECTOR IN "a, b"` and `REFERRING_CONNECTOR IN ["a", "b"]` would work.
  - Separating values by comma is still supported for the referring connector policy, it's just that it doesn't work with the `EQ` operator.
- API Wrapper: Renamed some fields and classes for the `createDataOffer` endpoint
- API Wrapper + Management API: Catalog requests now require a participantId
  - For `sovity-daps` variants this is optional, because we don't use SSI, but we align ourselves with Catena-X because it is easier to maintain one way of working with the EDC than maintain two
  - The UI Dashboard now gives you a `Connector Endpoint + Participant ID` with an appended `?participantId=...` instead of just a `Connector Endpoint`.
    This is so the UI flow of `Copy one URL from the dashboard -> Paste one URL into the Catalog` remains unchanged
  - The API now requires additional information of a Participant ID
- API Wrapper + Management API: Transfer Initiation Requests now have an additional required "transfer type". Here's an overview over what "types" we now have:
  - **Transfer Type**:
    - Data plane architectural flow type of the transfer
    - Decided by the consumer when initiating the transfer
    - Both data planes must support this transfer type
    - The selection might further limit what data address types are supported.
    - E.g. `HttpData-PUSH`,`HttpData-PULL`,`AmazonS3-PUSH`
  - **Data Source Type**:
    - How the data plane gets the byte array of data when providing
    - Decided by the provider when creating the asset
    - The provider data plane must support this transfer type
    - E.g. `HttpData`, `HttpProxy`, `HttpPush`, `AzureStorage`, `AmazonS3`
  - **Data Sink Type**:
    - How the data plane stores away the received byte array when consuming
    - Decided by the consumer when initiating a transfer
    - The consumer data plane must support this transfer type
    - E.g. `HttpData`, `HttpProxy`, `HttpPush`, `AzureStorage`, `AmazonS3`
- Asset JSON-LD changes:
  - All asset metadata under the DCAT Dataset field `http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#distribution` such as `mediaType`
    has been moved to `https://semantic.sovity.io/dcat-ext#distribution` because the Eclipse EDC now overrides the field with information
    regarding available data planes, causing asset metadata to get swallowed when querying the catalog. Previously the Eclipse EDC was
    already appropriating the `distribution` field for its own purposes, but because they used an incorrect DCAT context
    prefix `https://` instead of `http://`, it did not collide. Now they corrected it, so it collides, so we had to move our asset metadata
    to a custom field instead of following the DCAT standard.
- Published JARs have changed:
  - `api` - JAX-RS Interfaces for both our sovity EDC CE and sovity EDC EE
  - `java-client` - Java API Client library for both our sovity EDC CE and sovity EDC EE
  - `mappers-lib` - Utilities for parsing Asset JSON-LD, Policy JSON-LD and DCAT Catalog JSON-LD payloads
  - `jsonlld-lib` - Utilities for dealing with Eclipse EDC JSON-LD
- Reworked DAPS interaction:
  - The Client ID in the Keycloak must now be the Participant ID
    - SKI/AKI as a concept does not exist anymore
    - DAPS variants require re-registration of the connector at the DAPS under a new Client ID
    - The certificate can be re-used, but by experience a new client needs to be registered in the Keycloak, renaming does not seem to work.
  - The provider audience remains unchanged. It is expected to be the same as the Token URL
  - The endpoint audience was changed from ~~`idsc:IDS_CONNECTORS_ALL`~~ to `edc:dsp-api`
  - The claim ~~`referringConnector`~~ has been removed in favor of `azp`, which is a default claim and should contain the Client ID
    which should now coincide with the Participant ID

#### Minor Changes

- All variants now support being launched as Control Plane with an integrated Data Plane
- Hashicorp vault support
- Build information now shows release version instead of commit information
- Developer XP and debugging utilities:
  - `sovity.print.config` - Print effective config, dependency jars and extensions. Never use on customer connectors!
  - In-memory vault with initialization via env
  - Improved ability to test variants and versions thanks to the new module system
  - Improved ability to surgically replace EDC Extensions thanks to the new module system
  - All used EDC Configuration is now documented
  - All used vault entries are now documented
- Added more explicit legacy Omejdn DAPS support. Note, that this is not tested

#### Patch Changes

- Fixed a bug fetching over 5000 elements by fixing transaction use for API enpdoints.

#### Known Issues

Known issues to be fixed in upcoming releases.

- Documentation is currently still not up-to-date.
- Catena-X policies are currently not properly supported via the UI.

### Deployment Migration Notes

- Please re-deploy all connectors using our reworked [Productive Deployment Guide](docs/deployment-guide/goals/production-ce/README.md)
  - The configuration of our connectors has been reworked for better documentation and flexibility.
  - Database migration histories are not compatible. Migrating was unfortunately not possible due to missing information in the DB, that would have to be amended on both provider and consumer sides.
  - Note that the sovity EDC CE UI image is now  named `edc-ce-ui` instead of ~~`edc-ui`~~.
- Preconfigured Catalog URLs now require a suffix of `?particpantId=...` as they are no longer pure `Connector Endpoints` but a list of `Connector Endpoint + Participant ID`
- Base Paths for the Connector Backends are no longer opinionated. If you continue to want to have given base paths `/control` / `/data`,
  you need to configure them using the recommended properties.

## [v7.0.0] - 2023-12-06

### Overview

`MY_EDC_PARTICIPANT_ID` must now coincide with a DAT claim.
This fixes the Contract Negotiation issue that affected `5.0.0` and `6.0.0`.

### EDC UI

https://github.com/sovity/edc-ui/releases/tag/v2.2.0

### EDC Extensions

#### Major Changes

- Participant IDs must now coincide with a DAT claim.

#### Patch Changes

- Fixed an issue preventing Contract Negotiations.
- Fixed an issue preventing transfer processes from being marked as `COMPLETED` in Eclipse EDC `0.2`.
- Fixed policy and permission targets shown as warnings in the UI.
- Added example for using the API Wrapper to offer and consume data.
- Added CHANGELOG documentation.
- Marked `MY_EDC_NAME_KEBAB_CASE` as deprecated in favor of `MY_EDC_PARTICIPANT_ID`.

### Deployment Migration Notes

- The configured value of `MY_EDC_PARTICIPANT_ID` will now be validated via the DAPS:
  - The configured value of `MY_EDC_PARTICIPANT_ID` must coincide with the claim value `referringConnector`
    as configured for this Connector in the DAPS.
  - For MS8-migrated connectors, if the Participant ID was not configured well before, existing contract agreements
    will stop working. The Participant ID is referenced heavily in counter-party connectors, which makes a migration
    of Participant IDs for old contract agreements impractical.
- If a given data space has no "Participant ID" / "Connector ID" concept or does not use the `referringConnector` claim:
  - It is possible to override the checked claim by overriding `EDC_AGENT_IDENTITY_KEY`.
  - `EDC_AGENT_IDENTITY_KEY` could be set to the claim name of the AKI / SKI Client ID, which should always be part of
    the issued DAT. This would be `sub` for a sovity DAPS and `client_id` for an Omejdn DAPS.
  - `MY_EDC_PARTICIPANT_ID` would have to be set to the AKI / SKI Client ID.
- Renamed ~~`MY_EDC_NAME_KEBAB_CASE`~~ to `MY_EDC_PARTICIPANT_ID`. ~~`MY_EDC_NAME_KEBAB_CASE`~~ continues working, but
  prints a warning on startup if configured.

#### Compatible Versions

- Connector Backend Docker Images:
  - Dev EDC: `ghcr.io/sovity/edc-dev:7.0.0`
  - sovity EDC CE: `ghcr.io/sovity/edc-ce:7.0.0`
  - MDS EDC CE: `ghcr.io/sovity/edc-ce-mds:7.0.0`
- Connector UI Docker Image: `ghcr.io/sovity/edc-ui:2.2.0`

## [v6.0.0] - 2023-11-17

### Overview

Connectors are now pre-configured for the sovity DAPS over Omejdn.

This fixes issues with MDS Connectors not being able to connect to the MDS 2.0.

### EDC UI

https://github.com/sovity/edc-ui/releases/tag/v2.1.0

### EDC Extensions

#### Major Changes

- The default DAPS configuration now supports the sovity DAPS over Omejdn.

#### Patch Changes

- Improved `:extensions:wrapper:wrapper-common-mappers` for broker: `AssetJsonLdUtils`, made some methods public.
- Added example for using the API Wrapper to offer and consume data.

### Deployment Migration Notes

Omejdn DAPS users need to manually add the following Backend ENV Vars:

```yaml
EDC_OAUTH_PROVIDER_AUDIENCE: idsc:IDS_CONNECTORS_ALL
EDC_OAUTH_ENDPOINT_AUDIENCE: idsc:IDS_CONNECTORS_ALL
EDC_AGENT_IDENTITY_KEY: client_id
```

#### Compatible Versions

- Connector UI Docker Image: `ghcr.io/sovity/edc-ui:2.1.0`

## [v5.0.0] - 10.10.2023

### Overview

Migration from Eclipse EDC Milestone 8 to Eclipse EDC 0.2.1.

The API Wrapper and API Client Libraries can now be used to fully control a sovity EDC Connector.

### EDC UI

https://github.com/sovity/edc-ui/releases/tag/v2.0.0

### EDC Extensions

#### Major Changes

- Bump Eclipse EDC Version to `0.2.1`:
  - Now using the Data Space Protocol (DSP) over the ~~IDS Protocol~~.
  - Major changes to the Management API. See the postman collection / OpenAPI file.
- The Getting Started Docker Compose file is no longer to be used as reference for deployments:
  - The Getting Started Docker Compose file now launches connectors for local demo purposes.
  - For productive deployments, a detailed deployment guide has been added.
  - The Dev-Images now also require a PostgreSQL Database.
- Removed IDS Broker Extension.
- Removed IDS Clearing House Extension.

#### Minor Changes

- All Connector UI Endpoints were migrated to our UI API Wrapper. New UI API Wrapper Endpoints:
  - Asset Page
  - Create Asset
  - Delete Asset
  - Catalog / Data Offers
  - Contract Definition Page
  - Contract Negotiation Start / Detail
  - Create Contract Definition
  - Delete Contract Definition
  - Policy Definition Page
  - Create Policy Definition
  - Delete Policy Definition
  - Dashboard Page
- New modules with common UI models and mappers for the Connector UI and Broker UI: `:extensions:wrapper:wrapper-common-api` and `:extensions:wrapper:wrapper-common-mappers`.
- New module with centralized Vocab and utilities for dealing with EDC / DCAT JSON-LD: `:utils:json-and-jsonld-utils`
- New module with utilities for parsing DCAT Catalog responses for use in the UI API Wrapper and the Broker Server: `:utils:catalog-parser`
- New modules with utilities for E2E Testing Connectors: `:utils:test-utils` and `:extensions:test-backend-controller`

#### Patch Changes

- New modules in `:launchers:common` and `:launchers:connectors` so building different variants no longer requires separate builds.
- New module `:extensions:wrapper:wrapper-api` split from `:extensions:wrapper:wrapper` so integration tests in `wrapper` can use the Java Client Library.
- New JUnit E2E Tests in `:launchers:connectors:sovity-dev` that start two connectors and test the data exchange.

### Deployment Migration Notes

1. Deployment Migration Notes for the EDC UI: https://github.com/sovity/edc-ui/releases/tag/v2.0.0
2. The Connector Endpoint changed to `https://[FQDN]/api/dsp` from ~~`https://[FQDN]/api/v1/ids/data`~~.
3. The Management Endpoint changed to `https://[FQDN]/api/management` from ~~`https://[FQDN]/api/v1/management`~~.
4. The `v1` Eclipse EDC Management API has been replaced by the Eclipse EDC `JSON-LD` `v2` Management API. Our Postman Collection shows some example requests.
   However, a switch to our [API Wrapper](https://github.com/sovity/edc-ce/tree/v5.0.0/extensions/wrapper/README.md) is recommended. Despite our Use Case API Wrapper API still being in development,
   the Connector UI API Wrapper is fully functional and can be used in concatenation with our type-safe generated API Client Libraries to both provide and
   consume data offers.
5. The Connector now uses the Data Space Protocol (DSP) instead of the IDS Protocol. This requires different paths to be available from the internet.
   Please refer to our deployment guide for more information.
6. If the old protocol endpoint required HTTP communication to pass as a workaround for a certain bug, this should be undone now,
   with all protocol endpoints being secured by HTTPS/TLS.
