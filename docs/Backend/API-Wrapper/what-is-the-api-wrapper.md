## What is the API-Wrapper?

### sovity API-Wrapper

The EDC API-Wrapper contains several APIs that are included with our Connector-as-a-Service (CaaS) and are made accessible via our type-safe generated client libraries.

#### CaaS API

Special API endpoints available in our Connector-as-a-Service (CaaS). For a list of APIs provided by the API-Wrapper and how to use them, please refer to our postman collection.

#### UI API

#### Installing The Java Client Library
