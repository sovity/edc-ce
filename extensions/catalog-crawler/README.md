## About this Extension

The catalog crawler is a deployment unit depending on an existing Authority Portal's database:

- It periodically checks the Authority Portal's connector list for its environment.
- It crawls the given connectors in regular intervals.
- It writes the data offers and connector statuses back into the Authority Portal DB.
- Each Environment configured in the Authority Portal requires its own Catalog Crawler with credentials for that environment's DAPS.

## Why does this component exist?

The Authority Portal uses a non-EDC stack, and the EDC stack cannot handle multiple sources of authority at once.

With the `DB -> UI` part of the broker having been moved to the Authority Portal, only the `Catalog -> DB` part remains as the Catalog Crawler, 
as it requires Connector-to-Connector IAM within the given Dataspace.
