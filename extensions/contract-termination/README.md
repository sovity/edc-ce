## About this Extension

To allow contracts termination and cancellation while no official specification for this feature is available, we added our own extension, keeping the Core EDC intact.

## Why does this extension exist?

Contracts termination is not natively supported the in the EDC. Contracts in general can be terminated and this feature has been added here, waiting for an official implementation to be available.

## Details

When a User clicks "Terminate contract" on a contract agreement, a request is sent to the EDC to mark the contract agreement as terminated, both on the EDC's side and the counterparty's side.

The termination is saved in the EDC's database.
Any transfer started from this contract agreement will be rejected.

The implementation of contract agreements doesn't interfere with the existing EDC features besides terminating transfers that were started on terminated contract agreements.
