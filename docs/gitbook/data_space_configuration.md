Data Space Configuration
========

Depending on the type of data space, different components may be required, both as core services and as enablement services.
Enablement services run around the EDC, which itself is considered an enablement service.
These enablement services typically run on the company site that also hosts the EDC.
The enablement services are named this way because, as a whole, they enable a company to be able to offer data.

Following components are considered being enablement services, among others:
- Eclipse Data Space Connector
- Decentralized Digital Twin Registry
- Asset Administration Shell
- Simple Data Exchanger
- Item Relationship Service

In addition to the enablement services, there are core services. Core services are usually provided centrally in a data space. These can be, among others:
- Authority Portal
- Managed Identity Wallet / DAPS
- Central Metadata Broker
- Marketplace
- Semantic Hub
- BPN Discovery

In addition, there may also be individual components in a data space that need to be supported. A typical topic, for example, is the question of an entity that logs contract agreements and data transfers reliably and comprehensibly.
This component is typically named by the term Clearing House or Logging House.

The selection of components that are used in a data space usually depends on the use case of the data space and thus the purpose of exchanging data.
