## About this Extension

Using our [`sovity-messenger`](../sovity-messenger) extension, both providers and consumers can now terminate contracts in a transparent way. Contract termination information is persisted in its own table on both sides and terminated contracts will be prevented from being transferable.

## Why does this extension exist?

Contracts termination is not natively supported by the Data Space Protocol (DSP) or in the Eclipse EDC. Customer Feedback and real-world Dataspace projects have proven for there to be many reasons for a party to want to terminate a contract. We want to enable contract termination in a transparent way for all participating parties, the provider, the consumer, and if necessary, the authority via the Logging House.

## Details

When a User clicks "Terminate contract" on a contract agreement, a request is sent to the EDC to mark the contract agreement as terminated, followed by a notification and registration of that same termination on the counterpart's side.

The termination is saved in the EDC's database.
Any transfer started from this contract agreement will be rejected.
