Getting Started
========

### Local Demo of two EDC Connectors

For quickly starting two sovity EDC CE Connectors locally, please check out
our [Deployment Goal: Local Demo](../deployment-guide/goals/local-demo-ce).

### Example Use Case: Chat-App

As part of the sovity Community Edition ecosystem, the **Chat-App** provides a runnable demonstration of how to leverage the sovity EDC API-Wrapper, HttpData-PULL flows, and EDRs in a real-world application.

This open-source project combines backend logic and a user interface, making it a valuable resource for developers and users who want to explore and extend sovity EDC capabilities.

You can find the full source code and deployment instructions here:  
[Chat-App on GitHub](https://github.com/sovity/edc-ce/tree/main/examples/chat-app)

We recommend starting with the Chat-App to get hands-on experience and accelerate your understanding of the sovity EDC.

### Productive Connector Deployment

For deploying productive EDC Connectors with a fully-fledged Data Space Roll-In, please refer to
our [Deployment Goal: Production](../deployment-guide/goals/production-ce).
