# Dashboard Overview

The start page of your connector is the Dashboard, providing a quick overview of your Connector and its current usage. You can access the Dashboard via:
- Your Connector-UI-URL
- The portal by clicking on ```View frontend``` (if not already in the connector)
- Clicking on ```Dashboard``` in the left-hand navigation bar in your Connector UI.

The Dashboard consists of three sections:

- **Center**: Connector KPIs and Properties
- **Right**: General Information about the Connector

Individual details of the Dashboard may vary depending on the version of your own connector used. If you have any questions in this regard, please contact our Customer Service Desk at any time.
