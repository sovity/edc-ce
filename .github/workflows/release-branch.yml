# GitBook external customer documentation: This action creates a branch for each release, which can optionally be used in GitBook to maintain service-versioned documentation streamlined with service-releases.
# If an existing release is deleted and re-released, the original release-branch is deleted and recreated with the re-release.
# Simply deleting a release without re-releasing does not delete the release-branch, as it could already be used by GitBook.
