Which data transfer methods are supported by the EDC-Connector?
========

The connector supports three different data transfer modes:

1. HTTPData: The provider EDC fetches the data from its own backend and pushes it to the consumer's desired data sink.
2. HTTPProxy: The provider EDC fetches the data and passes it on consumer's data transfer request synchronously back to the consumer.

The following diagram illustrates the different transmission modes:

# Consuming Data via HttpProxy / HTTP Pull
The Use-Case Backend-Application is involved in steps b1, b4, b5 and b8 of the diagram. It should provide an endpoint for receiving
the EDR (b4). These information can then be used to start the tranfser request (b5). The result of the transfer request
will contain the data (b8). Please see related [documentation](./pull-data-transfer.md) about how to implement it technically.
