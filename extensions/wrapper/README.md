## About this Extension

This extension contains multiple APIs designed for auto-generation for API Clients.

[This extension](./wrapper) contains multiple components:

- Use Case API
- EDC UI API
- Further APIs to be included for our API Clients
- Our auto generated [Java API Client](./client)
- Our auto generated [TypeScript API Client](./client-ts)

For faster development we created this extension which will bundle multiple APIs our extended EDC supports.

The goal is to design the API in a way it can be used losslessly with OpenAPI 3.0 generators so we can seamlessly
generate both Java Clients and TypeScript Clients.

## Why does this extension exist?

Our UI needed an API we control. There were also concerns about the functionality of the Data Management API.

As there was a need to generate API clients for both Use Case Applications and TypeScript clients we decided to combine
the tasks to save time.

By having a dedicated API designed for auto generation, targeted for our consumers, we will be able to share code,
iterate faster and deliver faster.
