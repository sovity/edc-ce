## About this Extension Package

This extension bundles all functionalities for using the EDC with PostgreSQL persistence. It also includes the required
Flyway migrations and extensions.

### Details

The extension includes the edc-stores for the following edc-types:

- asset
- contractdefinition
- contractnegotiation
- dataplaneinstance
- policy
- transferprocess

Futhermore, the `ConnectionsPool`, `transaction`-Extensions and the JDBC-Driver for the
PostgreSQL-Database are provided.

The tables are prepared using Flyway, which executes the .sql scripts included in
the `resources/migration` folder.

## Why does this extension exist?

While the EDC is providing capabilities for individual persistence stores, our goal is to provide a single working
extension package to allow switching to a well-managed PostgreSQL persistence.
