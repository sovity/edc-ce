# 4. Publish a Data Offer

To make your data accessible to other data space participants, you must define a `Data Offer`. A `Data Offer` links policies to your assets and then offers it in your catalog, so that other participants can query these offers and depending on the policy set, can see them in their catalog browser and initiate a contract negotiation.

Here you can also get an overview of all `Data Offer` currently offered by your Connector.

To create a new `Data Offer` click on `Create Data Offer` button. This opens a new dialog where you can define the data offer details.

- **Data Offer ID**: Give your data offer a unique name.
- **Assets**: Choose the assets you want to offer with this data offer.
- **Access Policy**: Determines the conditions under which the data-offer is to be seen and accessed by other Connectors.
- **Contract Policy**: Determines the conditions for negotiating a contract.

Different policy types can be combined here as `Access-` and `Contract-Policy`.

Click on `Create Data Offer` to publish the data offer with the given policies in the ecosystem.
