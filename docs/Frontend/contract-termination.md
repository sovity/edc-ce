# Contract Termination

Both the provider and the consumer have the option of terminating an existing contract. To initiate a termination, simply click on an existing contract in the Contracts area, regardless of whether it is Providing or Consuming, and the red button at the bottom left `Terminate` of the Contract detail view in the tab `Contract Agreement`. Please be sure that you want to terminate the contract, because this process is irreversible and a new contract would have to be negotiated if a contract was terminated by mistake.

As soon as the `Terminate` button is clicked, a new dialog appears as a pop-up in which a `Detailed Reason` for termination must be specified. In addition, a checkbox must be ticked to confirm that you are aware of the consequences of terminating the contract `I understand the consequences of terminating a contract`. At this point, the contract has not yet been terminated, only when all the required fields have been filled in and then `Terminate` button has been clicked in this dialog pop-up at the bottom right of this dialog, the terminate-process will be triggered inevitably.

If a contract has been terminated, regardless of from which side, each side can see this very clearly in the `Contracts` area by the status icon, which is then crossed out in red.
There is also a separate sub-area in the `Contracts` area via the `Terminated` tab, which only lists terminated contracts.

By clicking on a terminated contract in the `Contracts` area, you can also see what the other side has entered in the termination details area, i.e. why the contract was terminated and by whom. In addition, a timestamp is provided when the contract was terminated.
