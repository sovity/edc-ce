Consuming Data via HttpProxy / HTTP Pull
========

## Data-Transfer Architecture

The following documentation describes the various supported data transfer architectures.
[Data Transfer Methods](./data-transfer-methods.md)

## Requirements

- An active contract agreement for a data offer you want to consume.
- A Use Case Application / Pull Backend that can be reached from the EDC, and that can reach the Data Planes of that
  EDC.

## Initiating the Transfer

For the EDC send an EDR to your backend application, you need to initiate a transfer process.

This "transfer process" represents the lifetime of your EDR in which your backend application can initiate as many
transfers as it wants, using the EDR it has received.

### Initiating the Transfer via the UI

When initiating the transfer, select `Custom Transfer Process Request (JSON)`, and provide:

```json
{
  "@type": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/TransferRequest",
  "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/dataDestination": {
    "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/type": "HttpProxy"
  },
  "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/privateProperties": {
    "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/receiverHttpEndpoint": "{{TARGET_PULL_BACKEND_URL}}"
  },
  "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/protocol": "dataspace-protocol-http",
  "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/managedResources": false
}
```

### Initiating the Transfer via the Management API

`POST` to `https://{{FQDN}}/api/management/v2/transferprocesses`

```json
{
  "@type": "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/TransferRequest",
  "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/assetId": "{{ASSET_ID}}",
  "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/contractId": "{{CONTRACT_ID}}",
  "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/connectorAddress": "https://{{PROVIDER_EDC_FQDN}}/api/dsp",
  "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/connectorId": "{{PROVIDER_EDC_PARTICIPANT_ID}}",
  "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/dataDestination": {
    "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/type": "HttpProxy",
    "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/baseUrl": "{{target-url}}"
  },
  "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/privateProperties": {
    "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/receiverHttpEndpoint": "{{target-pull-backend-url}}"
  },
  "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/protocol": "dataspace-protocol-http",
  "https://w3id.org/edc/v0.0.1/ns/managedResources": false
}
```

## Receiving an Endpoint Data Reference (EDR)

Your backend receives the EDR from the EDC by the EDC calling the `{{target-pull-backend-url}}` endpoint via `POST` method:
```json
{
  "id": "2d5348ea-b1e0-4b69-a625-07e7b093944a",
  "endpoint": "http://connector-a-dataplane-1:8185/public",
  "authKey": "Authorization",
  "authCode": "Token ..."
}
```

## Getting the Data

Using that EDR, requesting `GET` on the EDR's `{{endpoint}}` using the header `{{authKey}}: {{authCode}}`
will return the data.

### Accessing the Contract ID

The `authCode` JWT Token can be decoded to find the Contract Agreement ID.

### Parameterized HTTP Data Sources

- When method proxying is enabled on the providing side, the request method can be adjusted and will be used by the
  providing EDC when fetching data from the data source.
- When path proxying is enabled on the providing side, any appended path to the `{{ endpoint }}` will be proxied through
  to the data source.
- When query params proxying is enabled on the providing side, added query params will be passed through to the data
  source.
- When request body proxying is enabled on the providing side, the request body and content-type headers will be proxied
  to the provider side.
