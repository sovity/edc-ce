# Use Case Application Blueprints: The Chat-App Example

sovity provides Use Case Application blueprints that demonstrate how to leverage the sovity EDC through the use of the API-Wrapper client libraries. The **Chat-App** is one such blueprint that serves as a practical reference implementation.

It emulates a real-world use case where notifications must be sent between parties and connections established dynamically. This example guides developers step-by-step through multiple key components that are essential to understand when building use case applications with the sovity EDC.

The Chat-App is our endorsed way to build use case applications and will be continuously maintained to reflect best practices and platform updates, making it a reliable reference for your own projects.

## Why Use the Chat-App Blueprint?

- **Hands-On Learning:** A runnable, real-world example illustrating the construction of use case applications
- **Reference Implementation:** Acts as a blueprint that can be adapted and extended for your own needs
- **Comprehensive Coverage:** Walks through key components including data exchange, event handling, and connection management
- **Endorsed and Maintained:** Officially supported by sovity and kept up-to-date with platform changes
