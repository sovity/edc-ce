## About this Extension

This extension adds a policy function that allows validating the consuming EDC Connector's DAT Claim
value `referringConnector`. This would allow you to limit access to your data offer to specific consumers.

Adds permisison function with left side expression `REFERRING_CONNECTOR` with the only currently supported
operator being `EQ`.

## Why does this extension exist?

Especially in data spaces with brokers not all data offers should be pushed to the broker. Some data offers are only
for certain consumers, and this extension allows exactly that.
